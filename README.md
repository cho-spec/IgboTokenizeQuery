This is an Information Storage and Retrieval (ISR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) academic project for a Low Level Resource (LLR) language.

Unlike many of the worldâ€™s most popular languages like English, Spanish, Hindi, the Igbo language due to its intonational and vocabulary complexities, has few research done to improve and understand how information retrieval and storage techniques can be used on it, as well as including the language in more advanced AI powered technologies with natural language processing.
